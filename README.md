# Overview:
The Netflix Simulator Backend is a robust and efficient implementation of a Netflix-like streaming service, developed in C++ utilizing object-oriented programming principles. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of key concepts such as polymorphism, inheritance, and pointer manipulation. Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, the backend system serves as the backbone for a simulated streaming platform, enabling seamless management of movies, TV shows, user profiles, and streaming queues.
## Key Features:

### Object-Oriented Design

- Utilizes object-oriented programming paradigms to create a structured and modular codebase.
- Employs classes and objects to represent entities such as users, movies, and TV shows, allowing for easy management and organization of data.

### Polymorphism and Inheritance:

- Implements polymorphism, enabling the creation of classes with shared interfaces while allowing individual derived classes to provide their own implementations.
- Utilizes inheritance to establish relationships between classes, promoting code reuse and simplifying the overall design.

### Pointer Manipulation:

- Effectively utilizes pointers to manage dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
- Demonstrates skill in pointer arithmetic and memory management, ensuring efficient data manipulation and resource utilization.

### User Profile Management:

- Implements user profiles, allowing users to create, update, and delete their accounts.
- Supports features such as user authentication, password management, and profile customization.
